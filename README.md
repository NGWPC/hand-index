## Creating a schema for a given hand version

A new schema should be created in the schema directory for every unique HAND version. The main table definition to modify across HAND versions is the Hydrotable table. The hand index Hydrotable should have the same columns names as the hydrotable csv files produced by that version of HAND. The column types will be the same with the main difference being that some columns will be numeric array types instead of numeric types. This is because, during the HAND index creation process many columns from the hydrotable.csv files in a HUC are compressed to list format to save space. To identify which columns should be converted to a numeric array type in the Hydrotable sql schema definition run the script "./analyze_hydrotable_columns.py" on several sample hydrotables from a given HAND output directory.

Within a given HAND version there will also be different schemas for uncalibrated versus calibrated outputs. This is because the hydrotable used for calibrated versus uncalibrated data is different. So for example the fim100 version of HAND will have two schemas "./schema/hand-index-ver-fim100-uncalb.sql" and "./schema/hand-index-ver-fim100-calb.sql".
